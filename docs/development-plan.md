# Development Plan

The current goal is to turn Concentrate from a working scanner demo into a reliable JS/TS code graph indexer.

## Milestone 2: Reliable JS/TS Indexer

1. [x] Add directory graph support.
   - Add `Directory` nodes.
   - Represent containment as `Repo -> Directory`, `Directory -> Directory`, and `Directory -> File`.
   - Keep stable directory IDs based on project-relative paths.

2. [x] Add scan reporting and error tolerance.
   - Track discovered files, supported files, skipped files, parsed files, and failed files.
   - Add `--continue-on-error`.
   - Print a concise summary at the end of every scan.

3. [x] Add import resolution.
   - Keep existing `File -> Import` extraction.
   - Resolve relative imports to real source files when possible.
   - Add `Import -> RESOLVES_TO -> File`.

4. [x] Improve call graph modeling.
   - Keep raw call expression nodes.
   - Prepare the model for future `Call -> RESOLVES_TO -> Function` relationships.
   - Avoid claiming semantic resolution until it exists.

5. [x] Add JSONL export.
   - Export `nodes.jsonl`.
   - Export `relationships.jsonl`.
   - Use the export format as a debug and migration path.

6. [x] Add fixture-based tests.
   - Add small JS/TS fixture projects.
   - Assert graph counts and selected relationships.
   - Cover imports, classes, functions, and call expressions.

## Current Priority

Fixture-based tests are complete. Milestone 2 is complete.

## Milestone 3: Multi-Language Indexing

7. [x] Add Python parser support.
   - Detect `.py` files.
   - Extract Python imports, functions, classes, and calls.
   - Resolve simple relative imports such as `from .utils import utility`.
   - Cover the behavior with fixture tests.

## Current Priority

Python parser support is complete.

## Milestone 4: Project Structure

8. [x] Refactor scanner and CLI structure.
   - Move graph mutation and dedupe logic into `GraphBuilder`.
   - Move directory graph creation and import resolution into focused scanner modules.
   - Move CLI scan reporting into a shared presenter.
   - Share Tree-sitter traversal helpers between language parsers.
